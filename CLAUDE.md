## Project Overview

Amgi is an offline-first, Anki-compatible iOS flashcard client with sync-server
support, plus an EPUB reader with offline dictionary lookup. The Anki engine is
the upstream Rust crate (`anki-upstream/`, AGPL-3.0) compiled into an XCFramework
and called from Swift via C FFI + protobuf.

## Architecture (zoomed out)

```
AmgiApp (iOS app target — AmgiApp/, xcodegen → AmgiApp.xcodeproj)
  ├─ depends on → AnkiBridge  package (this repo's root Package.swift)
  ├─ depends on → AmgiReader  (sibling SPM, ./AmgiReader; vendors EPUBKit)
  ├─ depends on → AmgiUI      (sibling SPM, ./AmgiUI)
  └─ depends on → AmgiFeatures (sibling SPM, ./AmgiFeatures)

AmgiFeatures package — app-layer shared code + migrated features
  FeatureStats → AmgiCharts     FeatureTemplates     AmgiAppShared → AmgiAppCore
  Only two intra-package edges exist; everything else reaches sideways into
  AmgiUI/AmgiTheme/AnkiKit/AnkiClients. AmgiWidget links AmgiAppCore only;
  AmgiWatchApp links AmgiAppCore + AmgiCharts. Neither may reach AnkiClients —
  that is why the sink is two targets rather than one.

AnkiBridge package — Anki engine surface
  SwiftUI feature code (AmgiApp/Sources/{Decks,Review,Reader,Stats,…})
    ↓ @Dependency(\.xxxClient)
  AnkiClients          ─ thin @DependencyClient structs, live values
    ↓
  AnkiServices         ─ high-level facades (Decks, Scheduler, Sync, Stats…)
    ↓ backend.invoke(.factory(...))
  AnkiProtoBridge      ─ typed Request<R> factories, ServiceID/*Method enums,
                          protobuf ↔ Swift-mirror conversions
    ↓
  AnkiBackend          ─ Swift class wrapping the 4 C FFI symbols
    ↓ C FFI: anki_open_backend / anki_run_method /
              anki_free_response / anki_close_backend
  AnkiRustLib (binaryTarget) = AnkiRust.xcframework
    ↑ produced by ./scripts/build-xcframework.sh
  anki-bridge-rs/      ─ Rust crate exposing the C ABI; links anki-upstream
  anki-upstream/       ─ ankitects/anki rslib (vendored, AGPL-3.0)
```

**Rust owns**: SQLite collection DB, sync protocol, FSRS scheduling, card
template rendering, search, import/export.
**Swift owns**: SwiftUI views, navigation, charts, keychain, EPUB reader,
dictionary UI, widgets.

## Module Map

### `AnkiBridge` package (./Package.swift, root)
| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AnkiKit` | Pure Swift domain types (Rating, FSRSState, DeckInfo, …). No deps. |
| `AnkiProto` | Generated SwiftProtobuf types from 24 .proto files. **Package-internal** — only `AnkiBackend` and `AnkiProtoBridge` may import it. |
| `AnkiBackend` | Swift class wrapping the Rust C FFI; owns the backend pointer, dispatches `Request<R>`, decodes responses. Carries the `RPCObserver` hook. |
| `AnkiProtoBridge` | The sole sanctioned bridge between protobufs and Swift mirrors. Exposes `Request<R>` factories (`.deckNames`, `.getDeckTree`, …), `ServiceCatalog`, and `*Method` typed dispatch wrappers. Conversions live in `Sources/AnkiProtoBridge/Conversions/`. |
| `AnkiServices` | High-level service facades (`DecksService`, `SchedulerService`, `SyncService`, `StatsService`, `NotesService`, `NotetypesService`, `CardRenderingService`, `ImportExportService`, `CollectionService`). |
| `AnkiClients` | `@DependencyClient` structs + `liveValue` implementations. The UI's preferred entry point into the Anki engine; where no client wrapper exists, feature code may use an `AnkiServices` facade directly (sanctioned second tier — don't add thin pass-through clients just to avoid it). Direct `AnkiBackend` use is reserved for the composition root and low-level asset/config plumbing. |
| `AnkiSync` | KeychainHelper for sync credentials. |
| `AmgiCardWeb` | WebKit-based card renderer host. |
| `AnkiRustLib` | `binaryTarget` pointing at `AnkiRust.xcframework`. iOS-only. |

### Sibling SPM packages (path-resolved)
| Package / Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AmgiReader` (./AmgiReader) | Pure-Swift reader domain types — no EPUB/Cxx deps. |
| `AmgiReaderDictionary` (./AmgiReader) | Cxx-mode wrapper around `hoshidicts` (Yomitan-compatible offline dictionary). Isolated so importing `AmgiReader` stays Cxx-free. |
| `AmgiReaderEPUB` (./AmgiReader) | EPUB parsing built on the vendored EPUBKit. |
| `AmgiTheme` (./AmgiUI) | Palette data, theme tokens, resources. Themes are **data, not enum-bound code** (see memory). |
| `AmgiUI` (./AmgiUI) | Shared SwiftUI components built on `AmgiTheme`. |
| `EPUBKit` (./Libraries/EPUBKit) | Vendored MIT-licensed EPUB parser; consumed only by `AmgiReaderEPUB`. |
| `AmgiAppCore` (./AmgiFeatures) | The engine-free sink: preferences (`ReviewPreferences`, `ReaderPreferences`, `SyncPreferences`), `AccountStore`, app-group keys, `WidgetSnapshot(+Store)`, `StreakCalculator`, `CardFlag`. Deps: `AnkiKit`, `Sharing`. **Must never gain an `AnkiClients` dependency** — the widget and watch extensions link it, and that edge would drag the Rust engine into both. |
| `AmgiAppShared` (./AmgiFeatures) | The engine-touching half of the sink, iOS-only: `CollectionStore`, `ImportHelper`, `ShareSheet`, `CardContextMenu(+Model)`. Exists so `AmgiAppCore` can stay engine-free. |
| `AmgiCharts` (./AmgiFeatures) | Pure chart/heatmap views over `GraphsSnapshot` + palette. No `AnkiClients` path, so its previews render without linking the xcframework. **Compiled for watchOS in its entirety** — the watch links the product, so every file here must be watchOS-clean, not just the ones the watch renders. |
| `FeatureTemplates` (./AmgiFeatures) | Card-template editor (`DeckTemplateListView`, `TemplateEditorView`, `TemplateSourceEditor`, …). Lifted out of `Decks/` to close the Decks↔Review cycle; consumed by Settings and Review. |
| `FeatureStats` (./AmgiFeatures) | Stats dashboard — `StatsDashboardView` Container / `StatsDashboardContent` + `State` enum / `StatsDashboardModel`. Deps: `AmgiCharts`, `AnkiClients`. |

### App target
- `AmgiApp/` — Xcode project, generated by xcodegen from `project.yml`.
- Feature folders: `AmgiApp/Sources/{Decks,Review,Browse,Reader,Study,Sync,Settings,Watch,Widgets,Shared}`
  (`Stats/` and `Theme/` are gone — they migrated into `AmgiFeatures`/`AmgiUI`).
- Widget target shares `AmgiTheme` + `AnkiKit` + `AmgiAppCore` only — keep its deps narrow.

## Working with the Rust Backend

The Rust engine is a black-box RPC service. You never call it directly — you go
through the four layers in order:

1. **Add / change a .proto** in `anki-upstream/proto/anki/*.proto` (rare — only
   when upstream changes or you need a method we haven't surfaced).
2. **Regenerate Swift protobuf types**: `./scripts/generate-protos.sh`.
   Output lands in `Sources/AnkiProto/` as `Anki_<Service>_<Message>` types.
3. **Add a `Request<R>` factory** in `Sources/AnkiProtoBridge/Requests/`. This
   is where service ID + method ID + request/response types get bound:
   ```swift
   public static func getDeckTree(now: Int64 = 0) -> Request<Anki_Decks_DeckTreeNode> {
       .init(
           service: .decks,
           method: DecksMethod.getDeckTree,
           payload: Anki_Decks_DeckTreeRequest.with { $0.now = now }
       )
   }
   ```
   Add the service/method ID to `ServiceCatalog.swift` if it's not already there.
4. **Expose it via a service facade** in `Sources/AnkiServices/` and (if
   user-facing) a `@DependencyClient` in `Sources/AnkiClients/`.
5. **Rebuild the XCFramework** *only* if you changed `anki-bridge-rs/` or
   `anki-upstream/`. Pure protobuf/Swift changes do **not** require a rebuild.

The four C symbols (in `anki-bridge-rs/src/lib.rs`) are stable: `anki_open_backend`,
`anki_run_method`, `anki_free_response`, `anki_close_backend`. Don't add new FFI
symbols unless absolutely necessary — prefer routing through `anki_run_method`
with a new service/method pair.

## Build & Run — MCP, not shell

All builds, previews, and tests go through an MCP server. Do NOT hand-roll
`xcodebuild` or `swift build` to verify changes — the only shell steps are the
Rust/proto scripts and `xcodegen` below.

Two servers may be connected; pick the branch by what's available this session:

### Branch A — XcodeBuildMCP connected (`mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__*`) — preferred
- Call `session_show_defaults` once, then `build_sim` / `test_sim` — this is
  the ground truth for "it builds" / "tests pass". Works headlessly (no Xcode
  window needed) and is immune to the run-destination gotcha below.
- Simulator work: `install_app_sim`, `launch_app_sim`; drive the UI with
  `snapshot_ui` → `tap`/`batch`/`type_text` (never osascript — see memory).
- IDE-only tools (need Xcode.app open) go through the bridge:
  `xcode_ide_call_tool` exposes the full built-in set — `RenderPreview`,
  `DocumentationSearch`, `GetBuildLog`, `XcodeListNavigatorIssues`, etc.
  First bridge call after Xcode starts may time out; retry with
  `xcode_ide_list_tools({refresh: true})`.

### Branch B — only built-in Xcode MCP connected (`mcp__xcode__*`)
1. If `AmgiApp/project.yml` changed: `cd AmgiApp && xcodegen generate` (shell).
2. `XcodeListWindows` — get the `tabIdentifier` for AmgiApp.xcodeproj
   (open the project in Xcode first if no window is listed).
3. `BuildProject` with that tab — ground truth for "it builds".
4. On failure, `GetBuildLog`. Previews via `RenderPreview`, docs via
   `DocumentationSearch`, tests via `RunSomeTests` (suite names in
   `Tests/README.md`).

**Branch-B gotchas:**
- `xcodegen generate` resets the run destination; `BuildProject` then fails
  with a spurious "requires a development team" signing error (no team is
  configured — this repo builds for the simulator). Re-select a simulator in
  Xcode's toolbar or headlessly:
  ```bash
  osascript -e 'tell application "Xcode"
    set ws to first workspace document
    repeat with d in run destinations of ws
      if (name of d) is "iPhone 17 Pro" then set active run destination of ws to d
    end repeat
  end tell'
  ```
- `RunSomeTests` reports tests as "not run" until a simulator is booted AND
  the active run destination is set; freshly added test files may still show
  "No result" — fall back to `xcodebuild test -only-testing:` to confirm.

Either branch: SPM tests are compile-verified only under `swift test` because
`AnkiRustLib` is iOS-only (see memory) — run them on a simulator destination.

### Shell (scripts only — not for build verification)
```bash
# Rebuild the Rust XCFramework. Required when:
#   - anki-bridge-rs/ changes
#   - anki-upstream/ is updated
#   - a .proto file is added/changed (and protos are regenerated)
./scripts/build-xcframework.sh

# Regenerate Swift protobuf types from anki-upstream/proto/anki/*.proto
./scripts/generate-protos.sh

# Regenerate the Xcode project after project.yml changes
cd AmgiApp && xcodegen generate
```

macOS SPM builds are NOT a verification path: `AnkiProtoBridge` pulls in
`AnkiBackend` (iOS-only `AnkiRustLib`) and `AmgiUI` uses UIKit types, so both
fail on macOS. Only `swift build --target AnkiKit` works, and it proves little —
use `BuildProject`.

## Key Patterns

### Dependency Client (struct-closure DI)
```swift
@DependencyClient
public struct CardClient: Sendable {
    public var fetchDue: @Sendable (_ deckId: Int64) throws -> [CardRecord]
    public var answer: @Sendable (_ cardId: Int64, _ rating: Rating, _ timeSpent: Int32) throws -> Void
}

extension CardClient: DependencyKey {
    public static let liveValue: Self = {
        @Dependency(\.ankiBackend) var backend
        return Self(
            fetchDue: { deckId in /* call Rust backend */ },
            answer: { cardId, rating, timeSpent in /* call Rust backend */ }
        )
    }()
}
```

### Calling the Rust Backend
```swift
// Typed RPC: encode request protobuf → C FFI → decode response protobuf
let response: Anki_Decks_DeckTreeNode = try backend.invoke(
    service: AnkiBackend.Service.decks,
    method: AnkiBackend.DecksMethod.getDeckTree,
    request: Anki_Decks_DeckTreeRequest()
)
```

### Service Index Reference
| Service ID | Name | Key Methods |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | BackendSyncService | 3=SyncLogin, 5=SyncCollection, 6=FullUploadOrDownload |
| 3 | BackendCollectionService | 0=OpenCollection, 1=CloseCollection |
| 2 | CollectionService | 0=CheckDatabase |
| 7 | BackendDecksService | 8=GetDeckTree |
| 13 | BackendSchedulerService | 3=GetQueuedCards, 4=AnswerCard, 7=CountsForDeckToday |
| 25 | BackendNotesService | 5=GetNote |
| 29 | BackendSearchService | 0=SearchCards, 1=SearchNotes |

## Import Rules (Swift 6.2 + InternalImportsByDefault)

- `public import` for any module whose types appear in public API signatures
- `import` (internal) for modules used only within the file
- `@Table` structs need `public import StructuredQueries`
- `@DependencyClient` files need `public import Dependencies`
- SwiftProtobuf methods (serializedData, init(serializedBytes:)) need `import SwiftProtobuf`

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- **DeckTree with counts fails on fresh sync**: Use `now=0` to skip counts, fetch per-deck separately
- **SyncCollection returns FULL_DOWNLOAD for empty local DB**: Must auto-download, not just return "complete"
- **SourceKit false positives**: The IDE shows errors that don't exist in actual builds. Trust `swift build` / `xcodebuild`
- **Apple Compression framework has no zstd**: Rust handles zstd internally, no need for Swift-side compression
- **XCFramework is iOS-only**: `swift build` on macOS can't build AnkiBackend. Use `BuildProject` (Xcode MCP) or `xcodebuild` for full builds.
