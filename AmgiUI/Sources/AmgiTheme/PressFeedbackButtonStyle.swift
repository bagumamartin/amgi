/// Scale *and* dim, together: the scale is what reads on a large surface (a
/// deck card, a rating tile), the dim is what reads on a bare glyph or a text
/// chip too small for 4% of scale to be visible. One style covering both is
/// the point — a control that looks like another control has to feel like it,
/// and the app previously had a scale idiom in the component library and a
/// dim idiom in the screens.
///
/// The feedback starts on press-*down*, and the spring means a press aborted
/// mid-travel reverses from wherever the scale currently is rather than
/// snapping back from its target.
