/// The project's motion vocabulary.
///
/// Every animated state change in the app resolves through here rather than
/// spelling its own `.easeInOut(duration:)`. Two reasons:
///
/// 1. **Springs, not curves.** A fixed-duration curve can't be interrupted
///    mid-flight, can't start from the value currently on screen, and can't
///    inherit a gesture's velocity. A spring does all three for free — a new
///    target just re-aims the same continuous motion. `standard` is
///    critically damped (no overshoot); `momentum` carries a little bounce
///    and is reserved for motion that follows a flick, throw, or arrival
///    from offscreen, where overshoot reads as physics rather than as decor.
/// 2. **Reduce Motion is handled once.** Under the accessibility setting every
///    role degrades to a short cross-fade, so no call site has to remember.
///
/// `duration` here is a spring's *response* — how fast it converges — not a
/// fixed runtime. The motion settles when the physics say so.
