/// Answer reveal for the native card surface (R12).

/// A 3D `rotation3DEffect` flip rasterizes SwiftUI text into an offscreen
/// texture and samples it at low effective resolution at steep angles, so the
/// answer settles in visibly blurred for ~200ms before snapping crisp. Instead
/// the two sides cross-dissolve with a small settle-in scale — vector-crisp
/// throughout, and still reads as a reveal.
///
/// Reveal (`showBack` false→true) animates; reset (→false, on advance or undo)
/// snaps instantly so a new card never plays a stale reverse animation.
///
/// Only the native path uses this; WebView cards swap sides directly, because a
/// live `WKWebView` rasterizes even worse under a transform.
