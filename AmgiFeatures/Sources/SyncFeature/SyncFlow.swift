/// the previous `() -> Void` entry made every reader — the tab bar's toolbar
/// — invalidate on each root body evaluation. The one stored property is a
/// class reference, which SwiftUI compares by identity, and `@State` in
/// `SyncFlowModifier` keeps a single instance, so the value is stable.
///
/// Resolution timing note (2026-08-29): `callAsFunction()` resolves
/// `@Dependency(\.syncCoordinator)` at tap time, while `SyncFlowModifier`
/// resolves its own copy when the modifier is constructed. In the shipping
/// app these are the same instance — `bootstrap()` installs one coordinator
/// process-wide — so this never diverges today. It would diverge under a
/// `withDependencies { $0.syncCoordinator = fake }` scope wrapped around view
/// construction, the normal way a preview or test host injects a fake: the
/// modifier's `.onChange` handlers would observe the fake while a tap here
/// would still resolve the real one. Not fixed here — would mean storing the
/// coordinator in `SyncAction` alongside the toast, a real code change.
