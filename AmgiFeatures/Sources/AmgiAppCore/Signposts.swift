/// Without these an Instruments capture is anonymous: a Time Profiler trace
/// reports session totals ("522 ms in conformance lookups") with no way to
/// attribute a millisecond to opening the deck list or answering a card.
/// Every interval here lands on the **Points of Interest** track, so
/// `xctrace export --xpath '…table[@schema="os-signpost"]'` reads them back
/// and the inspection range can be set to exactly one action.
///
/// Lives beside `Log` in `AmgiAppCore` for the same reason: it is engine-free
/// and already linked by every consumer, so routing signposts through it adds
/// no dependency edges.
///
/// Two rules, both load-bearing:
/// - Names are `StaticString` because that is what the signpost API records
///   and what shows up in the `name` column. They are the join key between
///   captures — keep them stable, and put dynamic detail in the message.
/// - The category must be `.pointsOfInterest`. Any other category is recorded
///   but never appears on the Points of Interest track, and the stock
///   template only instruments that one.
